= Bithug
More docs to come.
Also, code is probably broken and in some flux atm.
Come back after 2010/01/31 (that's our deadline).

== How do I install Bithug?
You don't.

Having said that:
Run @rake@ to set things up. Also, you'll need redis.

== TODO / Known Bugs
* Merge routes/ stuff into lib/, refactor refactor!
* Webinterface.
