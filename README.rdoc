= Bithug
More docs to come.
Also, code is probably broken and in some flux atm.
Come back after 2010/01/31 (that's our deadline).

== How do I install Bithug?
You don't.

Having said that:
Run +rake+ to set things up. Also, you'll need redis.

== Starting the server

Try something along the lines of

  ruby init.rb

or

  thin start -D -R config.ru
